    "Installation on Unix-like systems is nothing more than to either download or clone the [Asteroid github repository](https://github.com/lutzhamel/asteroid) or download one of the prepackaged releases and add the `code` directory of the repository/release to your `PATH` environment variable.  Be sure that you have Python 3.x installed. Make sure that the file `code/asteroid` has execution privileges on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows 10 you will need to set the environment variable `ASTEROID_ROOT` to point to the folder where you cloned the repo or unzipped the downloaded file.  Then you will need to add the following to the `path` environment variable: `%ASTEROID_ROOT%\\code`.  That's it, now you can use the `asteroid.bat` file to start the asteroid interpreter.\n",
