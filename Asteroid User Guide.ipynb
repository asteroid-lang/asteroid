    "The Asteroid programming language is a programming language that makes pattern matching one of its core computational mechanisms.  John Backus identified value-level (object-level) programming languages as programming languages that combine various values to form other values until the final result values are obtained. Virtually all our classic programming languages today including C, C++, and Java belong into this category. Here we identify pattern-level (term-level) programming languages that combine various patterns to form other patterns until the final result patterns are obtained. New patterns are constructed from existing ones by the application of pattern-to-pattern functions exploiting pattern matching and constructors. First-order logic programming languages such as Prolog, OBJ, and Maude belong into this category. Our insight that pattern-level and value-level programming gives rise to a pattern-value duality is used as the foundation of the design of our new programming language called Asteroid. Hallmarks of this new programming language design are the developer’s ability to explicitly control the interpretation or model of expression terms and the notion of ‘patterns as first class citizens’. In addition to a complete implementation of pattern-level programming Asteroid also supports an object-oriented style of programming based on prototypes and also subject to pattern matching."

    "In this document we describe the major features of Asteroid and give plenty of examples.  For the most part Asteroid should appear very familiar.  However, there are some features which differ drastically from other programming languages.  Here are just two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All assignments are pattern-match statements.  For example if I state,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let [x,2,y] = [1,2,3].\n",
    "```\n",
    "that means the subject term `[1,2,3]` is matched to the pattern `[x,2,y]` and `x` and `y` are bound to the values 1 and 3, respectively.  By the way, there is nothing wrong with this statement,\n",
    "```\n",
    "let [1,2,3] = [1,2,3].\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Asteroid allows for list slicing.  Consider the example,\n",

    "print b.\n",

    "let b = a@[1]. -- access element 1 and return it in a list\n",
    "print b.\n",

    "would print the value `[2]`.  We can take advantage of this capability by reverse the list a with a simple indexing operation,\n",

    "We introduce Asteroid's objects using the dog example from the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).  The code below shows that Python example translated into Asteroid.  Asteroid's object system is prototype based.  In Asteroid it is the convention that object members are given as name-value pairs.  That also includes function members in addition to data members.  In our example we define our prototype object with three members: two data members, `\"name\"` and `\"tricks\"` and one function `\"add_trick\"`.  Object members are accessed in Asteroid's dictionary style syntax.  What makes this truly object-oriented is the fact that when an object function is accessed in the context of a function call, like do `fido@{\"add_trick\"}(\"roll over\").`, Asteroid generates an implicit object reference as the first argument to the called function.  Notice that at the call site  we only provide a single arguments whereas the function definition has two arguments; the first one capturing the object reference.\n"

    "Over the course of the previous discussions we have seen plenty of instances where we replaced one Asteroid model with another by using the appropriate `attach` and `detach` commands to manipulate the interpretation of constructors.  What is perhaps not so obvious is that we can also create overloaded models, that is, models where constructors have more than one interpretation. The example below shows a program that creates an overloaded model for the `*` operator.  Here we start by loading the standard model.  Note that in the standard model the interpretation for the `*` operator is the `mult_op` function from the `math` module.  Next we define a function that recursively computes the dot product of two vectors.  We define the function `mult_op_overloaded` that will serve as the new interpretation for the `*` operator.  This function performs one of two computations depending on the type of its arguments.  If the arguments are vectors/lists then it will compute the dot product of the two vectors otherwise it will compute the multiplication of two scalars using the `mult_op` function.  We replace the original interpretation of the `*` operator with our new overloaded model by first detaching the original interpration and then attaching our new interpretation.  Observe that this new model preserves the original interpration of the `*` operator if the arguments are not vectors.  "
