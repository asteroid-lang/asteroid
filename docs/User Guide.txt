Asteroid User Guide
===================

Introduction
------------

Asteroid is a modern, application-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language supporting first-class patterns.
The language is heavily influenced by `Python <https://www.python.org>`_, `Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org>`_, `ML <https://www.smlnj.org>`_, and `Prolog <http://www.swi-prolog.org>`_.  Furthermore, Asteroid is 
dynamically typed and makes pattern matching one of its core computational mechanisms.  When we talk about pattern matching we mean both structural pattern matching
as well as regular expression matching.

In this document we describe the major features of Asteroid and give plenty of examples.  If you have used a programming language like Python or JavaScript before, then Asteroid should appear very familiar.  However, there are some features which differ drastically from other programming languages due to the core pattern-matching programming
paradigm with first-class patterns.  Here are just two examples:

**Example:** All statements that look like assignments are actually pattern-match statements.  For example if we state,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-001.ast"

that means the subject term ``[1,2,3]`` is matched to the pattern ``[x,2,y]`` and ``x`` and ``y`` are bound to the values 1 and 3, respectively.  By the way, there is nothing wrong with the following statement,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-002.ast"

which is just another pattern match without any variable instantiations.

**Example:** Patterns in Asteroid are first-class citizens of the language.
This is best demonstrated with a program.  Here is a program
that recursively computes the factorial of a positive integer and uses first-class patterns
in order to ensure that the domain of the function is not violated,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-003.ast"

As you can see, the program first creates patterns and stores them in the variables
``POS_INT`` and ``NEG_INT`` and it uses those patterns later in the code by
dereferencing those variables with the ``*`` operator.  First-class patterns have
profound implications for software development in that pattern definition and usage
points are now separate and patterns can be reused in different contexts.

These are just two examples where Asteroid differs drastically from other programming languages.
This document is an overview of Asteroid and is intended to get you started quickly
with programming in Asteroid.


The Basics
----------

As with most programming languages we are familiar with, Asteroid has variables (alpha-numeric symbols starting with an alpha character) and constants.  Constants are available for all the primitive data types,

* ``integer``, e.g. ``1024``
* ``real``, e.g. ``1.75``
* ``string``, e.g. ``"Hello, World!"``
* ``boolean``, e.g. ``true``

Asteroid arranges these primitive data types in a type hierarchy,

``boolean`` < ``integer`` < ``real`` < ``string``

Type hierarchies facilitate automatic type promotion.  Here is an example
where automatic type promotion is used to put together a string from different data types,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-004.ast"

Here we associate the string ``"value: 1"`` with the variable ``x`` by first promoting the integer value ``1`` to the string ``"1"`` using the fact that ``integer`` < ``string``  according to our type hierarchy  and then interpreting the ``+`` operator as a string concatenation operator.

Asteroid supports two more built-in data types:

* ``list``
* ``tuple``

These are structured data types in that they can contain entities that belong to other data types. Both of these data types have constructors which are possibly empty sequences of comma separated values enclosed by square brackets for lists, e.g. ``[1,2,3]``, and enclosed by parentheses for tuples, e.g. ``(x,y)``. For tuples we have the caveat that the 1-tuple is represented by a value followed by a comma to distinguish it from parenthesized expressions, e.g. ``(3,)`` the 1-tuple versus ``(3)`` the parenthesized expression.
Here are some examples,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-005.ast"

As we said above, in order to distinguish it from a parenthesized value the single element in a 1-tuple has to be followed by a comma, like so,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-006.ast"

Lists are mutable objects whereas tuples are immutable.  Lists and tuples themselves are also embedded in type hierarchies, although very simple ones:

* ``list`` < ``string``
* ``tuple`` < ``string``

That is, any list or tuple can be viewed as a string.  This is very convenient for printing lists and tuples,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-007.ast"

Here the ``+`` operator acts like a string concantenation operator with the list ``[1,2,3]`` promoted to a string according to the above type hierarchy.

Finally, Asteroid supports one more type, namely the ``none`` type.  The ``none`` type has
only one member: A constant named ``none``.  However, it turns out that the null-tuple, a tuple with no components
indicated by ``()``, also belongs to this type rather than the tuple type discussed earlier. But the ``none``
data type only has one constant, this implies that ``()`` and ``none`` mean the same thing and can be used
interchangeably.  That is, the following ``let`` statements will succeed,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-008.ast"

showing that ``()`` and ``none`` are equivalent and pattern-match each other.
The ``none`` data type itself does not belong to any type hierarchy.

By now you probably figured out that statements are terminated with a period and that comments start with a ``--`` symbol and continue till the end of the line.  You probably also figured out that the ``let`` statement is Asteroid's version of assignment even though the underlying mechanism is a bit different as we will see when we discuss pattern matching in more detail.

Data Structures
---------------

Lists
^^^^^

In Asteroid the ``list`` is a fundamental, built-in data structure.  A trait it shares with programming languages such as Lisp, Python, ML, and Prolog.  Below is a list reversal example program.  Notice that lists are zero-indexed and
elements of a list are accessed via the ``@`` operator,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-009.ast"

The output is: ``[3,2,1]``.

We can achieve the same effect by giving a list of index values (a slice) to the ``@`` operator,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-009a.ast"

In Asteroid lists are considered objects with member functions that can manipulate list
objects. We could rewrite the above example as,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-010.ast"

The ``@`` operator is Asteroid's general access operator.
It allows you to access either individual elements, slices, or member functions of a list.
It also allows for access to members and functions of tuples and objects.
Notice that in order to access the ``println`` function of the ``io`` module we also use the ``@`` operator.
This is because in Asteroid, system modules are objects, so you must use ``@`` to access the functions
of the module.

For a comprehensive treatment of available member functions for lists and tuples please see the reference guide.  We look at objects later on in this guide.

Besides using the constructor for lists which consists of the
square brackets enclosing comma separated elements we can use list comprehensions to construct lists.  In Asteroid a list comprehension consist of a range specifier together with
an optional step specifier allowing you to generate integer values within that range,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-011.ast"

The output is,
::

    list: [1,3,5,7,9]
    reversed list: [9,7,5,3,1]

Asteroid's simple list comprehensions in conjunction with the ``map`` function for lists allows you to
construct virtually  any kind of list. For example, the following program constructs
a list of alternating 1 and -1,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-012.ast"

where the output is,
::

    [1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1]



Tuples
^^^^^^

As we saw earlier, the tuple is another fundamental, built-in data structure that can be found in Asteroid.
Below is an example of a tuple declaration and access.
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-014.ast"

Lists and tuples may be nested,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-015.ast"

As we have mentioned earlier, unlike lists, tuples are immutable. This means that their contents cannot be changed once they have been declared.  The following program demonstrates this,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-016.ast"

Which will print out the following message:
::

    SystemError: term '(a,b,c)' is not a mutable structure

Should we want to change the contents of an already declared tuple, we would need to abandon the original and create a new one with the updated contents.
When to use tuples and when to use lists is really application dependent.
Tuples tend to be preferred over lists when representing some sort of structure,
like abstract syntax trees, where that structure is immutable meaning, for example,
that the arity of a tree node cannot change.

Structures and Objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can introduce custom data structures using the ``structure`` keyword.  For example,
the following statement introduces a structure of type ``A`` with data members ``a`` and ``b``,
::
    structure A with
       data a.
       data b.
    end

Structures differ from lists and tuples in the sense that the name of the structure acts like a type tag.  So, when you define a new structure you are in fact introducing a new type into your program.   

For each structure Asteroid creates
a default constructor that instantiates an object from that structure.  The default constructor copies the arguments given to it into the
data member fields in the order that the arguments and data members appear in the program text.
Also, the data fields of an object are accessed via
their names rather than index values.  Here is a simple example that illustrates
all this,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-017a.ast"

The following is a more involved example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-017.ast"

The output is,
::

    Sophie is 46 years old and is a woman.


The ``structure`` statement introduces a data structure of type ``Person`` with the three data members ``name``, ``age``, and ``gender``.  We use this data structure to build a list of persons.  One of the interesting things is that we can pattern match the generated data structure as in the second ``let`` statement in the program to extract
information from a ``Person`` object.

In addition to the default constructor, structures in Asteroid also support user specified
constructors and member functions.  We'll talk about those later when we talk about OO programming in Asteroid.

The Let Statement
-----------------

The ``let`` statement is a pattern matching statement of the form,
::
    let <pattern> = <value>.

where the pattern on the left side of the equal sign is matched against the value of the right side of the equal sign.  When the pattern consist of just a single variable then the let statement can be viewed as Asteroid's version of the assignment statement, e.g.,
::
    let x = 1.
    
However, statements like,
::

    let 1 = 1.

where we pattern match the pattern 1 on the left side to the value 1 on the right side are completely legal and highlight the fact that the let statement is not equivalent to an assignment statement.  

Simple patterns are expressions that consist purely of constructors and variables. Constructors themselves consist of constants, list and tuple constructors, as well as user defined structures.
The advantage of pattern matching is that it provides direct access to substructures of a particular value.
Consider that we want to access the constituent values of the pair ``(1,2)``.  In a non-pattern-matching approach we would have to access each of these constituent values one-by-one,
::
    let p = (1,2).
    let x = p@0.
    let y = p@1.
    assert (x==1 and y==2).

But in a pattern-matching approach we can write a ``let`` statement with a pattern that looks like a pair with 
the variables ``x`` and ``y`` where we expect our values to be,
::
    let p = (1,2).
    let (x,y) = p.
    assert (x==1 and y==2).

Matching the pattern against the value ``(1,2)`` stored in ``p`` first matches the pair structure against the pair value and the matches the variables to the appropriate substructures.  Once the variables have been matched to value the ``let`` statement declares the variables in the current scope and they become available for computation.

The following is an example involving structures and objects,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-018.ast"

We first construct an object ``joe`` with the first ``let`` statement and the use pattern matching to desctructure it with the second ``let`` statement binding its substructures to the variables ``n``, ``a``, and ``p``.

Asteroid supports special patterns called type patterns that match any value
of a given type.  For instance, the ``%integer`` pattern matches any integer value.  Here is a simple example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-019.ast"

This let statement succeeds because ``1`` is an integer value can be pattern-matched against
the type pattern ``%integer``. 

Asteroid also
supports something called a named pattern were a (sub)pattern can be given a name
and that name will be instantiated with a term during pattern matching.  For example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-020.ast"

Here, the construct ``t:(x,y)`` is called a named pattern and the variable ``t`` will be unified with the term ``(1,2)``, or more generally, the variable will be unified with term
that matches the pattern on the right of the colon.  The program will print,
::
    (1,2)

Named patterns are a shorthand notation for conditional patterns; in this case,
::
    let t if t is (x,y) = (1,2).

We can combine type patterns and named patterns to give us something that looks
like a variable declaration in other languages. In Asteroid, though, it is still just all
about pattern matching.  Consider,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-021.ast"

The left side of the ``let`` statement is a named type pattern that matches any real value, and
if that match is successful then the value is bound to the variable ``x``.  Note
that even though this looks like a declaration, it is in fact a pattern matching
operation.  The program will print the value ``3.141592653589793``.

Beware of the fact that even though the ``let`` statement above looks like a 
declaration of a real variable it is not; it is a pattern match statement enforcing that the 
value assigned to ``x`` matches the pattern ``%real``.  Since this is a pattern match statement, this 
also means that standard type promotions such as promoting integers to reals during assignments in other 
programming languages do not apply here.  For example, in Asteroid the following let statement fails,
::
    let x:%real = 1.

because ``1`` is an integer value and does not match the pattern ``%real``.

Flow of Control
---------------

Control structure implementation in Asteroid is along the lines of any of the modern programming languages such as Python, Swift, or Rust.  For example, the ``for`` loop allows you to iterate over lists without having to explicitly define a loop index counter. In addition, the ``if`` statement defines what does or does not happen when certain conditions are met in a very familiar way. For a list of all control statements in Asteroid, please take a look at the reference guide.

As we said, in terms of flow of control statements there are really not a lot of surprises. This is because Asteroid supports loops and conditionals in a very similar way to many of the other modern programming languages.  For example, here is a short program with a ``for`` loop that prints out the first six even positive integers,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-022.ast"

The output is,
::

    0
    2
    4
    6
    8
    10

Here is another example that iterates over lists,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-023.ast"

The output is,
::

    the first bird is a turkey
    the second bird is a duck
    the third bird is a chicken

In the loop we first create a list of pairs using the ``zip`` function, over which we then
iterate pattern matching on each of the pairs on the list with the pattern ``(ix,bird)``.

The following is a short program that demonstrates an ``if`` statement,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-024.ast"

Even though Asteroid's flow of control statements look so familiar, they support pattern matching to a degree not found in other programming languages and which we will take a look at below.

Functions
---------

Functions in Asteroid resemble function definitions in functional programming languages such as Haskell and ML.
Here functions definitions have a single formal argument and function calls are expressed via juxtaposition
of the function name and the single actual argument.  Here is a simple example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-025a.ast"

In the ``with`` expression we pattern match the actual argument that is
being passed in against the variable ``i``.  Also note that the function call is expressed via juxtaposition,
no parentheses necessary.

If we wanted to pass more than a single value to a function we have to create
a tuple and then pass that tuple to the function like in this example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-025b.ast"

Even though the function call looks like a traditional function call like in
Python it is not.  The underlying mechanism is quite different: on the call site
we construct a tuple that holds all our values which is then passed to the function as the only parameter.
Within the function that tuple is pattern matched and whatever variables are
instantiated during this pattern match can be used within the function body.

In Asteroid functions are multi-dispatch, that is,
a single function can have multiple bodies each attached to a different pattern
matching the actual argument.
The following is the quick sort implemented in
Asteroid where each ``with`` clause introduces a new function body with its
corresponding pattern,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-026.ast"

The output is as expected,
::

    [0,1,2,3]

Notice that we use the multi-dispatch mechanism to deal with the base cases in the first two ``with`` clauses.
In the third ``with`` clause we use the pattern ``[pivot|rest]`` to match the input list.
Here the variable ``pivot`` matches the first element of the list, and the variable ``rest`` matches the remaining list. This remaining list is the original list with its first element removed.
The function body then implements the pretty much standard recursive definition of the
quick sort.  Just keep in mind that function calls are expressed via juxtaposition
of function name and actual argument; no parentheses necessary.

As you have seen in a couple of occasions already in the document, Asteroid also supports anonymous or ``lambda`` functions.  Lambda functions behave just like regular
functions except that you declare them on-the-fly and they are declared without a
name.  Here is an example using a ``lambda`` function,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-027.ast"

The output is ``2``.  Here, the ``lambda`` function is a function that takes a value
and increments it by one.  We then apply the value ``1`` to the function and the
print function prints out the value ``2``.

Pattern Matching
----------------

Pattern matching lies at the heart of Asteroid.  We saw some of Asteroid's pattern matching ability when we discussed the ``let`` statement.  Here is a more general discussion of pattern matching.

Pattern Matching in Expressions: The Is Predicate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can also have pattern matching
in expressions using the ``is`` predicate.
Consider the following example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-028.ast"

Here we use patterns to determine if ``p`` is a triple, a pair, or something else. Pattern matching is embedded in the expressions of the ``if`` statement using the ``is`` predicate. The
output of this program is,
::

    it's a pair with: 1,2

Pattern matching with the ``is`` predicate can happen anywhere expressions can
be used.  That means we can use the predicate also on the right side of ``let`` statements,
::

    let true = (1,2) is (1,2).

This is kind of strange looking but it succeeds.  Here the
left operand of the ``is`` predicate is a term and
the right operand is a pattern.  Obviously this pattern match will succeed because the
term and the pattern look identical.  The return value of the ``is`` predicate is then
pattern matched against the ``true`` pattern on the left of the ``=`` symbol.

We can also employ pattern matching in loops.
In the following program we use the ``is`` predicate to test whether a list is empty or not
while looping,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-029.ast"

The output is,
::

    1
    2
    3

The example employs pattern matching using the head-tail operator in order to iterate over the list elements and print them.  The
termination condition of the loop is computed with the ``is`` predicate.

Pattern Matching in Function Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we have seen earlier, Asteroid supports pattern matching on function arguments in the style of ML and many other functional programming languages.
Here is an example that uses pattern matching on function arguments using binary tree data structures,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-030.ast"

The structures ``Node`` and ``Leaf`` allow us to construct binary trees with embedded values.
The ``traverse`` function traverses such trees and collects the values embedded in a tree on a list 
and returns that list.  Notice the pattern matching on the tree node constructs in the ``with`` clauses
of the ``traverse`` funtion.  

Conditional Pattern Matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Asteroid allows the user to attach conditions to patterns that need to hold in order
for the pattern match to succeed.  This is particularly useful for restricting
input values to function bodies.  Consider the following definition of the
``factorial`` function where we use conditional pattern matching to control
the kind of values that are being passed to a particular function body,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-031.ast"

Here we see that first, we make sure that we are being passed integers and second,
that the integers are positive using the appropriate conditions on the input values. If
we are being passed a negative integer, then we throw an error.

The above factorial program can be simplified by rewriting the first condition on ``n`` as a named pattern and also taking advantage of the fact that the last expression evaluated in a function body provides an implicit return value gives us,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-031a.ast"

The parentheses as they appear in the conditional pattern expressions are necessary.

Pattern Matching in For Loops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have seen pattern matching in ``for`` loops earlier.  Here we show another
example. This combines structural matching with regular expression matching
in ``for`` loops
that selects certain items from a list. Suppose we want to print out the names of persons that contain a lower case 'p',
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-032.ast"

Here we pattern match the ``Person`` object in the ``for`` loop and then use a regular expression to see if the name of that person matches our requirement that it contains a lower case 'p'.  The output is ``Sophie``.

Pattern Matching in Try-Catch Statements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Exception handling in Asteroid is very similar to exception handling in many of the other modern programming languages available today.  The example below shows an Asteroid program  that throws one of two exceptions depending on the randomly generated value ``i``,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-033.ast"

The ``Head`` and ``Tail`` exceptions are handled by their corresponding ``catch`` statements, respectively.  In both cases the exception object is unpacked using pattern matching and the unpacked value is used in the appropriate message printed to the screen.

It is worth noting that even though Asteroid has builtin exception objects such as ``Error``,
you can construct any kind of object and throw it as part of an exception.


Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and Pattern Matching
-------------------------------------------------------------

We saw structures such as,
::

    structure Person with
        data name.
        data age.
    end

earlier.  It is Asteroid's way to create custom data structures. These structures
introduce a new type name into a program. For instance, in the case above, the ``structure``
statement introduces the type name ``Person``.   Given a structure definition, we can
create objects from that structure.  For example,
::

    let scarlett = Person("Scarlett",28).

The right side of the ``let`` statement invokes the default constructor for the
structure in order to create an object stored in the variable ``scarlett``. We
can access members of the object,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-034.ast"

Asteroid allows you to attach functions to structures.  In member functions
the object identity is available through the ``this`` keyword.
For example, we can
extend our ``Person`` structure with the ``hello`` function that uses the ``name`` field
of the object,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-035.ast"

This program will print out,
::
    Hello, my name is Scarlett

The expression ``this@name`` accesses the ``name`` field of the object the
function ``hello`` was called on.
Even though our structures are starting to look a bit more like object definitions,
pattern matching continues to work in the same way from when we discussed structures.
The only thing you need to keep in mind is that you cannot pattern match on a
function member field.  From a pattern matching perspective, a structure consists only of
data fields.  So even if we declare a structure like this,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-036.ast"

where the function ``hello`` is defined in the middle of the data fields,
pattern matching simply ignores the function definition and pattern matches
only on the data fields.  The output of the program is,
::
    Scarlett is 28 years old

Here is a slightly more involved example loosely based on the
dog example from the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html>`_.
The idea of the dog example is to have a structure that describes dogs by their
names and the tricks that they can perform.   Rather than using the default
constructor, we define a constructor for our instances with the ``__init__`` function
that performs some basic type checking on its arguments using type patterns and then 
initializes the data members of the object.
Here is the program listing for the example in Asteroid,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-037.ast"

After declaring the structure we instantiate the dogs with their
respective trick repertoires and put them on a list.  The last couple of lines
of the program consist of a ``for`` loop over a list of our dogs.
The ``for`` loop is interesting
because here we use structural, conditional, and regular expression pattern
matching in order to only select the dogs that know how to do ``fetch`` from
the list of dogs.  The pattern is,
::
    Dog(name,tricks) if type @tostring tricks is ".*fetch.*"

The structural part of the pattern is ``Dog(name,tricks)`` which simply matches
any dog instance on the list.  However, that match is only successful if
the conditional part of the pattern holds,
::
    if type @tostring tricks is ".*fetch.*"

This condition only succeeds if the ``tricks`` list viewed as a string matches
the regular expression ``".*fetch.*"``. That is, if the list contains the word ``fetch``.
The output is,
::
    Fido knows how to fetch
    Bella knows how to fetch


Patterns as First-Class Citizens
--------------------------------

A programming language feature that is promoted to first-class status does not
change the power of a programming language in terms of computability but it does
increase its expressiveness.  Think functions as first-class citizens of a programming
language.  First-class functions give us ``lambda`` functions and ``map``, both powerful
programming tools.

The same is true when we promote patterns to first-class citizen status in a language.  It
doesn't change what we can and cannot compute with the language. But it does change how
we can express what we want to compute.  That is, it changes the expressiveness
of a programming language.

In Asteroid first-class patterns are introduced with the keyword ``pattern``
and patterns themselves are values that we can store in variables and then reference
when we want to use them.  Like so,
::

    let p = pattern (x,y).  -- define a first-class pattern 
    let *p = (1,2).         -- use the first-class pattern

The left side of the second ``let`` statement dereferences the pattern stored in variable ``p``
and uses the pattern to match against the value ``(1,2)``.

Here we look at three examples of how first-class patterns can add to a developer's
programming toolbox.

Pattern Factoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Patterns can become very complicated especially when conditional pattern matching
is involved.  First-class patterns allow us to control the complexity of patterns
by breaking patterns up into smaller subpatterns that are more easily managed. Consider
the following function that takes a pair of values.  The twist is that
the first component of the pair is restricted to primitive data types of
Asteroid,
::

    function foo with (x if (x is %boolean) or (x is %integer) or (x is %string),y) do
        io @println (x,y).
    end

That complicated pattern for the first component of the input pair completely obliterates the
overall structure of the parameter pattern and makes the function definition
difficult to read.

We can express the same function with a first-class pattern,
::
    let TP = pattern q if (q is %boolean) or
                          (q is %integer) or
                          (q is %string).

    function foo with (x:*TP,y) do
        io @println (x,y).
    end

It is clear now that the main input structure to the function is a pair and the
conditional type restriction pattern has been relegated to a subpattern stored in the variable
``TP``.

Pattern Reuse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most applications of patterns in programming languages specific patterns appear
in many spots in a program.  If patterns are not first-class citizens the developer
will have to retype the same patterns over and over again in the various different
spots where the patterns occurs. Consider the following program snippet,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-038.ast"

In order to write these two functions we had to repeat the almost identical pattern
four times.  First-class patterns allow us to write the same two functions in a
much more elegant way,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-039.ast"

The relevant patterns are now stored in the variables ``POS_INT`` and ``NEG_INT``
which are then used in the function definitions.

Constraint Patterns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes we want to use patterns as constraints on other patterns.  Consider
the following (somewhat artificial) example,
::

   let x: (v if (v is %integer) and v > 0) = some_value.

Here we want to use the pattern ``v if (v is %integer) and v > 0`` purely as a constraint
on the pattern ``x`` in the sense that we want a match on ``x`` only to succeed
if ``some_value`` is a positive integer.  The problem is that this constraint pattern
introduces a spurious binding of the variable ``v`` into the current environment
which might be undesirable due to variable name clashes.  Constraint patterns
address this.  We can rewrite the above statement as follows,
::

   let x: %[v if (v is %integer) and v > 0]% = some_value.

By placing the pattern ``v if (v is %integer) and v > 0`` within the ``%[...]%``
operators the pattern still functions as before but does not bind the variable ``v``
into the current environment.

The most common use of constraint patterns is the prevention of non-linear patterns
in functions.  Consider the following program,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-043.ast"

Without the ``%[...]%`` operators around the pattern ``v if (v is %integer) and v > 0``
the argument list pattern for the function
``(a:*POS_INT,b:*POS_INT)`` would instantiate two instances of the variable ``v``
leading to a non-linear pattern which is not supported by Asteroid.
With the ``%[...]%`` operators in place we prevent
the pattern ``v if (v is %integer) and v > 0`` from instantiating the variable ``v`` thus preventing a non-linearity
to occur in the argument list pattern.

Sometimes we need to use constraint patterns instead of straightforward patterns
in order to avoid non-linearities but
we also want controlled access to the variables these constraint patterns declare.
We achieve this by using the ``bind`` keyword at the pattern-match site.  
Consider the following program,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-043a.ast"

In the function definition of ``dot2d`` we see that the ``Pair`` pattern is used 
twice to make sure that the function is called with a pair of pairs as its argument.
However, in order to compute the dot product of those two pairs we need access 
to the values each pair matched.  We use the ``bind`` keyword together with an 
appropriate binding term list to extract the matched values.  For the first
pair we map ``x`` and ``y`` to ``a1`` and ``a2`` and for the second 
pair we map ``x`` and ``y`` to ``b1`` and ``b2``, respectively.

As a quick aside, the ``as`` construction in the binding term list is only necessary 
when trying to resolve non-linearities otherwise the binding term list can just consist
of the variable names appearing in the pattern that you want to bind into the current
scope.


Basic Asteroid I/O
------------------

I/O functions are defined as member functions of the ``io`` module. The ``println`` function prints its argument in a readable form to the terminal.  Recall that the ``+`` operator also implements string concatenation.  This allows us to construct nicely formatted output strings,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-051.ast"

The output is
::

    a + b = 3

We can use the ``tostring`` function defined in the ``type`` module to provide some
additional formatting. The idea is that the ``tostring`` function takes a value to be turned into a string together with an optional ``stringformat`` formatting specifier object,
::

    type @tostring(value[,type @stringformat(width spec[,precision spec])])

The width specifier tells the ``tostring`` function how many characters to reserve for the string conversion of the value.  If the value requires more characters than given in the width specifier then the width specifier is ignored.  If the width specifier is larger than than the number of characters required for the value then the value will be right justified.  For real values there is an optional precision specifier.

Here is a program that exercises some of the string formatting options,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-052.ast"

The output of the program is,
::

          true
        5
                      hello there!
     3.142

Notice the right justification of the various values within the given string length.

The ``io`` module also defines a function ``print`` which behaves just like ``println``
except that it does not terminate print with a newline.

Another useful function defined in the ``io`` module is the ``input`` function that, given an optional prompt string, will prompt the user at the terminal and return the input value as a string.  Here is a small example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-053.ast"

The output is,
::

    What is your name? Leo
    Hello Leo!


We can use the type casting functions such as ``tointeger`` or ``toreal`` defined in the
``type`` module to convert the string returned from ``input`` into a numeric value,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-054.ast"

The output is,
::

    Please enter a positive integer value: 3
    1
    2
    3


Finally, the function ``read`` reads from ``stdin`` and returns the input as a string.  The function ``write`` writes a string to ``stdout``.

The Module System
-----------------

A module in Asteroid is a file with a set of valid Asteroid statements.
You can load this file into other Asteroid code with the statement::

   load "example_path/example_filename".

or::

   load example_modulename.

The search strategy for a module to be loaded is as follows,

1. raw module name - could be an absolute path
2. search in current directory
3. search in directory where Asteroid is installed
4. search in subdirectory where Asteroid was started

Modules defined by the Asteroid system should be loaded with the keyword ``system``
in order to avoid any clashes with locally defined modules.  If the ``system``
keyword is used then Asteroid only searches in its system folders
rather than in user directories.

Say that you wanted to load the ``math`` module so you could execute a certain trigonometric function. The following Asteroid program loads the ``math`` module as well as the ``io``  module. Only after loading them would you be able to complete the sine function below,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-055.ast"

Both the function ``sin`` and the constant value ``pi`` are defined in the ``math`` module.
In addition, the ``io`` module is where all input/output functions in Asteroid (such as ``println``) come from.
If you want the complete list of modules, make sure to check out the reference guide `here <https://asteroid-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Reference%20Guide.html>`_.


More on Exceptions
------------------

This section will give further information on how to work with exceptions, or unexpected conditions that break the regular flow of execution.  Exceptions generated by Asteroid are ``Exception`` objects with the following structure,
::

    structure Exception with
        data kind.
        data value.
    end

The ``kind`` field will be populated by Asteroid with one of the following strings,

* ``PatternMatchFailed`` - this exception will be thrown if the user attempted an
  explicit pattern match which failed, e.g. a let statement whose left side pattern
  does not match the term on the right side.

* ``NonLinearPatternError`` - this exception occurs when a pattern has more than
  one variable with the same name, e.g. ``let (x,x) = (1,2).``

* ``RedundantPatternFound`` - this exception is thrown if one pattern makes another
  superfluous, e.g. in a multi-dispatch function definition.

* ``ArithmeticError`` - e.g. division by zero

* ``FileNotFound`` - an attempt of opening a file failed.

* ``SystemError`` - a general exception.

In addition to the ``kind`` field, the ``value`` field holds a string with some further details on the exception. Specific exceptions can be caught by pattern matching on the ``kind`` field of the ``Exception`` object.  For
example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-045.ast"

The output is,
::

    integer division or modulo by zero


Asteroid also provides a predefined ``Error`` object for user level exceptions,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-046.ast"

Of course the user can also use the ``Exception`` object for their own exceptions
by defining a ``kind`` that does not interfere with the predefined ``kind`` strings above,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-047.ast"

The output here is,
::

    something worth throwing

In addition to the Asteroid defined exceptions,
the user is allowed to construct user level exceptions with any kind of object including tuples and lists. Here is an example that constructs a tuple as an exception object,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-048.ast"

The output of this program is ``42``.

Now, if you don't care what kind of exception you catch, you need to use a ``wildcard`` or a variable because exception handlers are activated via pattern matching on the
exception object itself.  Here is an example using a ``wildcard``,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-049.ast"

Here is an example using a variable,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-050.ast"

In this last example we simply convert the caught exception object into a string
and print it,
::

    something happened: Exception(PatternMatchFailed,pattern match failed: term and pattern
    lists/tuples are not the same length)


More on Multi-Dispatch
----------------------

With the ``qsort`` function above we saw functional programming style dispatch
where the ``with`` clauses represent a case analysis over a single type, namely
the input type to the function.
However, Asteroid has a much broader view of multi-dispatch where the ``with`` clauses
can represent a case analysis over different types.
In order to demonstrate this type of multi-dispatch, we show the example program from the
`multi-dispatch Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_dispatch>`_
written in Asteroid,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ug-programs/prgm-044.ast"

Each ``with`` clause in the function ``collide_with`` introduces a new function body with its
corresponding pattern.
The function bodies in this case are simple ``return`` statements
but they could be arbitrary computations.  The output of the program is,
::

    Big boom!
    a/s
    s/s
