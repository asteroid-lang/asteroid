Asteroid Programming Language Documentation
===========================================

**Asteroid** is an open source, dynamically typed, multi-paradigm programming language heavily influenced by Python, Rust, ML, and Prolog currently under development at the University of Rhode Island.  Asteroid implements a new programming paradigm called pattern-matching oriented programming.  In this new programming paradigm patterns and pattern matching are supported by all major programming language constructs making programs succinct and robust.  Furthermore, patterns themselves are first-class citizens and as such can be passed to and returned from functions as well as manipulated computationally.
