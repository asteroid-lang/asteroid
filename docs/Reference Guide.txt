Asteroid Reference Guide
========================

Language Syntax
---------------

Note: In the following descriptions ``<something>?`` denotes an optional
something in a piece of syntax.  We also use the notation ``<something>*``
which means that something can appear zero or more times in a program.
Capitalized
words are keywords where ``FOR`` represents the keyword ``for`` and ``END``
represents ``end``.

Statements
^^^^^^^^^^

Assert
%%%%%%

Syntax: ``ASSERT exp '.'?``

If the expression of the assert statement evaluates to a
value equivalent to the Boolean value
``false`` an exception is thrown otherwise the statement is ignored.

For example, the statement,
::
      assert (1+1 == 3).

will generate a runtime error but the statement,
::
      assert (1+1 == 2).

will be ignored once the expression has been evaluated.


Break
%%%%%

Syntax: ``BREAK '.'?``

The break statement immediately breaks out of the closest surrounding looping structure.
Execution will continue at the statement right after the loop. Issuing a break statement
outside of a looping structure will lead to a runtime error.

As an example we break out of the indefinite loop below when ``i`` is equal to 10,
::
      let i = 0.

      loop
         let i = i+1.
         if i==10 do
            break.
         end
      end

      assert (i==10).

Expressions at the Statement Level
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Expressions at the statement level are supported.  However, they do not have
any effect on the computation unless they contain side effects with one
exception:  In the absence of an explicit return statement, the value of the last expression
evaluated in a function body is considered the return value of the function.

An example,
::
      function inc
         with i do
            i+1.
         end

Notice that because the expression ``i+1`` is the last statement evaluated in the
function body its value becomes the return value of the function.

For-Loop
%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``FOR pattern IN exp DO stmt_list END``

In a for-loop the expression must evaluate to a list.  The pattern is then matched to
each element of the list sequentially starting with the first element of the list.
The loop body is executed for each successful match.

In the following program the body of the loop is executed exactly once when
the pattern matches the tuple ``(1,"chicken")``,
::
      let tuple_list = [
              (0,"duck"),
              (1,"chicken"),
              (2,"turkey")
              ].

      for (1,bird) in tuple_list do
         assert(bird is "chicken").
      end


Function-Definition
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: FUNCTION function_name WITH pattern DO stmt_list (WITH pattern DO stmt_list)* END

Function definitions in Asteroid can have one or more function bodies associated
with single function name.  A function body is associated with a particular pattern
that is matched against the actual argument of the function call.  If the match
is successful then the associated function body is executed.  If the match is not
successful then other pattern/body pairs are tried if present.  If none of the
patterns match the actual argument then this constitutes a runtime error.
Patterns are tried in the order they appear in the function definition.

The following is a definition of the ``sign`` function,
::
      function sign
         with x if x >= 0 do
            return 1.
         with x if x < 0 do
            return -1.
      end

Here the first function body returns ``1`` if the actual argument is greater or equal to zero.
The second function body return ``-1`` if the actual argument is less than zero.

Global
%%%%%%

Syntax: ``GLOBAL variable_name (',' variable_name)* '.'?``

The ``global`` statement allows the developer to declare a variable as global
within a function scope and this allows the developer to set the value of a global variable
from within functions.

Consider the following code snippet,
::
      let x = 0.

      function foo
         with none do
            global x.
            let x = 1.
      end

      assert(x==0).
      foo().
      assert(x==1).

The ``global`` statement within the function ``foo`` indicates that the ``let`` statement
on the following line should assign a value to the global variable ``x``.

If-Then-Else
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``IF exp DO stmt_list (ELIF exp DO stmt_list)* (ELSE DO? stmt_list)? END``

If the first expression evaluates to the equivalent of a Boolean ``true`` value
then the associated statements will be executed and the execution
continues after the ``end`` keyword.  If the expression evaluates to the equivalent
of a Boolean ``false`` then the expressions of the optional ``elif`` clauses
are evaluated if present.  If one of them evaluates to the equivalent of a Boolean
value ``true`` then the associated statements are executed and execution continues
after the ``end`` keyword. Otherwise
the statements of the optional ``else`` clause are executed if present and again
flow of control is transferred to the statements following the if-statement.

As an example consider the following ``if`` statement that determines
what kind of integer value the user supplied,
::
      load system io.
      load system type.

      let x = type @tointeger (io @input "Please enter an integer: ").

      if x < 0 do
          io @println "Negative".
      elif x == 0 do
          io @println "Zero".
      elif x == 1 do
          io @println "One".
      else do
          io @println "Positive".
      end


Let
%%%

Syntax: ``LET pattern = exp '.'?``

The ``let`` statement is Asteroid's version of the assignment statement with a twist though:  the left side of the ``=`` sign is not just a variable
but is considered a pattern.  For simple assignments there is no discernible difference between assignments in Asteroid and assignments in other
languages,
::
  let x = val.

Here, the variable ``x`` will match the value stored in ``val``.  However, because the left side of the ``=`` sign is a pattern we
can write something like this,
::
  load system math.
  let x:%[(k:%integer) if math @mod(k,2)==0]% = val.

where ``x`` will only match the value of ``val`` if that value is an even integer value.  The fact that the left side of the ``=`` is a pattern allows
us to write things like this,
::
   let 1 = 1.

which simply states that the value ``1`` on the right can be matched by the pattern ``1`` on the left.  Having the ability to pattern match
on literals is convenient for statements like these,
::
  let (1,x) = p.

This ``let`` statement is only successful for values of ``p`` which are pairs where the first component of the pair is the value ``1``.


Loop
%%%%

Syntax: ``LOOP DO? stmt_list END``

The ``loop`` statement executes the statements in the loop body indefinitely
unless a ``break`` statement is encountered.

Repeat-Until
%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``REPEAT DO? stmt_list UNTIL exp '.'?``

Repeatedly execute the statements in the loop body until the
expression evaluates to the equivalent of a Boolean ``true`` value.

Here is an example of a program that prints out the elements
of a list,
::
      load system io.

      let l = ["bmw", "volkswagen", "mercedes"].

      repeat
         let [element|l] = l.
         io @println element.
      until l is [].


Return
%%%%%%

Syntax; ``RETURN exp? '.'?``

Explicitly return from a function with an optional return value.

Structure
%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``STRUCTURE type_name WITH data_or_function_stmts END``

The ``structure`` statement introduces a composite data type that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name.  The variables within a structure can be declared as data members or as function members.
Unless a member function was declared as a constructor (an ``__init__`` function) structures are
instantiated using a default constructor. The default constructor copies the arguments given to it into the data member fields in the order that the data members appear in the structure definition and as they appear in the parameter list of the constructor.  We often refer to instantiated structures as objects.  Member values of objects
are accessed using the access operator ``@``. Here is a simple example,
::
      -- define a structure of type A
      structure A with
          data a.
          data b.
      end

      let obj = A(1,2).       -- call default constructor
      assert( obj @a == 1 ).  -- access first data member
      assert( obj @b == 2 ).  -- access second data member

We can use custom constructors to enforce that only certain types of values
can be copied into an object,
::
      -- define a structure of type Person
      structure Person with
          data name.
          data age.
          function __init__ with (name:%string,age:%integer) do -- constructor
             let this @name = name.
             let this @age = age.
          end
          function __str__ with none do
            return this@name+" is "+this@age+" years old".
          end
      end

      let betty = Person("Betty",21).  -- call constructor
      assert( betty @name == "Betty" ).
      assert( betty @age == 21 ).

      load system type.
      assert(type @tostring betty is "Betty is 21 years old").

Note that object identity is expressed using the ``this`` keyword.
Here we also supplied an instantiation of the ``__str__`` function that allows
us to customize the stringification of the object.  See the last line
where we cast the object ``betty`` to a string.  Without the ``__str__`` function
Asteroid uses a default representation of the object as a string.
The ``__str__`` function does not accept any arguments and has to return a string.

Try-Catch
%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``TRY DO? stmt_list (CATCH pattern DO stmt_list)+ END``

This statement allows the programmer to set up exception handlers for
exceptions thrown in the code of the ``try`` part of the statement.
Notice that you can set up one or more handlers within the ``catch`` part of
the statement.  If there are more than one handlers then they are searched in
order starting with the first.  Handlers are selected via pattern matching
on the exception object.  The handler code of the first ``catch`` clause whose
pattern matches the exception object is executed.

Below is an example of a ``try-catch`` statement where the code
in the ``try`` part generates a division-by-zero exception.  The
exception object is pattern-matched in the ``catch`` clause and processed
by the associated handler,
::
      load system io.

      try
          let x = 1/0.
      catch Exception("ArithmeticError", s) do
          io @println s.
      end

For more details on exceptions please see the User Guide.

Throw
%%%%%

Syntax: ``THROW exp '.'?``

Allows the developer to throw an exception.  Any object can serve as an
exception object. However, Asteroid provides some predefined exception objects.
For more details on exceptions please see the User Guide.

While-Loop
%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``WHILE exp DO stmt_list END``

While the expression evaluates to the equivalent of a Boolean ``true`` value
execute the statements in the body of the loop.  The loop expression is reevaluated
after each loop iteration.

Here is an example that prints out a sequence of integer values in reverse order,
::
      load system io.

      let i = 10.

      while i do
         io @println i.
         let i = i-1.
      end

The loop terminates once ``i`` becomes zero which is the equivalent to a Boolean
value ``false``.

Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^

All the usual arithmetic, relational, and logic operators,
::
      +, -, *, /, ==, =/=, <=, <, >=, >, and, or, not

are supported in
Asteroid.  For extended mathematical operations such as ``mod`` (modulus) or
``sin`` (sine) see the ``math`` module.  Here we discuss expression constructions
that are particular to Asteroid.

Substructure Access
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``structure_exp @ index_exp``

Asteroid provides the uniform substructure access operator ``@`` for all structures
which includes lists, tuples, and objects. For example, accessing the first
element of a list is accomplished by the expression,
::
      [1,2,3] @0

Similarly, given an object constructed from structure ``A``, member values
are accessed by name via the ``@`` operator,
::
      structure A with
         data a.
         data b.
      end

      let obj = A(1,2).
      assert( obj @a == 1 ).  -- access member a


Head-Tail Operator
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``element_exp | list_exp``

This operator works in one of two ways.  In the first way it allows you to
pre-append an element to a list,
::
      let [1,2,3] = 1 | [2,3].

It can also be nested,
::
      let [1,2,3] = 1 | 2 | 3 | [].

In the second way it works as a pattern to deconstruct a list into its first
element and the remainder of the list, the list with its first element removed,
::
      let h | t = [1,2,3].
      assert(h == 1).
      assert(t == [2,3]).

You can put optional brackets around the operator to highlight the fact that
we are dealing with a list,
::
      let [h | t] = [1,2,3].

The Is Predicate
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``exp IS pattern``

This operator matches the structure computed by the expression on the left
side against the pattern on the right side of the operator.  If the match is
successful it returns the Boolean value ``true`` and if not successful then
it returns the Boolean value ``false``.  All regular rules of pattern matching
apply such as instantiating appropriate variable bindings in the current scope.

Example,
::
      if v is (x,y) do
         io @println "success".
         assert(isdefined "x").
         assert(isdefined "y").
      else
         io @println "not matched".
         assert(not isdefined "x").
         assert(not isdefined "y").
      end

The In Predicate
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``exp IN list_exp``

This predicate returns ``true`` if the value computed by the expression on the
left in contained in the list computed by the list expression on the right.
It is an error if the expression on the right does not compute a list.

Example,
::
      let true = 1 in [1,2,3].

The Eval Function
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The ``eval`` function allows you to evaluate Asteroid expressions.  If the expression
is a string then the contents of the string is treated like Asteroid code and is
interpreted accordingly in the current interpreter environment.  If that code produces a value then the ``eval`` function
will return that value, e.g.,
::
      let a = eval "1+1".
      assert(a == 2).

If the expression to be evaluated is a simple, structural pattern then the pattern is 
evaluated as a constructor where variables are instantiated from the current environment.
For example,
::
      let p = pattern (x,y)
      let x = 1.
      let y = 2.
      let o = eval p.
      assert(o is (1,2)).

List Comprehensions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``start_exp TO end_exp (STEP exp)?``

This expression constructs a list starting with an element given by the start expression
up to the value of the end expression with a given step.  If the step expression
is not given then a step value of 1 is assumed. The comprehension can be placed between
optional square brackets.

Examples,
::
      let [0,1,2,3,4] = 0 to 4.
      let [0,-2,-4,-6] = [0 to -6 step -2].

Function Calls
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``exp exp``

Function calls are defined by function application, more specifically by
juxtaposition of expressions.  Here, the first expression has to evaluated to
a function expression and the second expression has to evaluate to an appropriate
actual function parameter.  Notice that function calls are defined in terms of a
single function parameter.  If you would like to pass more than one value to a
function then you have to create a tuple.  For example, if the function ``foo``
needs two values to be passed to it then you need to create a tuple, e.g. ``foo (1,2)``.
In that respect function calls differ drastically from function calls in languages
like C/C++ or Python.

Examples,
::
      let val = (lambda with i do i+1) 1.
      assert(val == 2).

      function foo with (q,p) do q+p end
      let val = foo (1,2).
      assert(val == 3).

If-Else Expressions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``then_exp IF bool_exp ELSE else_exp``

If the boolean expression evaluates to true then this expression returns
the value of the first expression.  Otherwise it will return the value of the
last expression.

Example,
::
      let val = "yup" if b else "nope".

If ``b`` evaluates to true then this expression returns the string ``"yup"``
otherwise it returns the string ``"nope"``.

First-Class Patterns
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

| Syntax: ``PATTERN exp``
| Syntax: ``'*' exp (BIND '[' ID (AS ID)? (',' ID (AS ID)?)*']')?``

This construction allows the user to construct a pattern as a value using
the ``pattern`` keyword.  The advantage of patterns as values is that they
can be stored in variables or passed to or from functions.  As an example
we construct a pattern which is a pair where the first component is the constant
``1`` and the second component is the variable ``x`` and we store this pattern
in the variable ``p`` for later use,
::
      let p = pattern (1,x).

The pattern derefence operator ``*`` allows us to retrieve patterns from
variables, e.g.
::
      let *p = (1,2).

Here the pair ``(1,2)`` is matched against the pattern stored in the variable ``p``
such that ``x`` is bound to the value ``2``.

The optional ``bind`` term together with an appropriate list of variable names 
allows the user to selectively project variable bindings from a constraint pattern 
into the current scope.  The ``as`` keyword allows you to rename those bindings.
Consider the following program,
::
      let Pair = pattern %[(x,y)]%.

      -- bindings of the variables x and y are now visible as a and y respetively
      let *Pair bind [x as a, y] = (1,2).  
      assert( a == 1).
      assert(y == 2).

At the second  ``let`` statement we bind the ``x`` as ``a`` and ``y`` from the hidden scope 
of the constraint pattern into our current scope.

Type Patterns
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``'%'type_name``

Type patterns match all the values of a particular type.  Type patterns exist
for all the Asteroid builtin types and are also available for user defined
types introduced via a ``structure`` command.

Example,
::
      let true = 1 is %integer.

Named Patterns
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``name_exp ':' pattern``

Named patterns allow you to bind the term matched by the pattern to a variable.
Here the name expression has to evaluate to either a variable,
object member variable, or list location.

Example,
::
      let x:%integer = val.

The variable ``x`` will be bound to the value of ``val`` if that value matches the
type pattern ``%integer``.

Named patterns are a syntactic short hand for the equivalent conditional pattern,
::
      name_exp if name_exp is pattern

That means the following two ``let`` statements are equivalent,
::
      let x:(q,p) = (1,2).
      let x if x is (q,p) = (1,2).

Conditional Patterns
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``pattern IF cond_exp``

In conditional patterns the pattern only matches if the condition expression
evaluates to true.

Example,
::
      load system math.
      let k if (math @mod(k,2) == 0) = val.

Here ``k`` only matches the value of ``val`` if that value is an even number.

Pure Constraint Patterns
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Syntax: ``%[ pattern ]% (BIND '[' ID (AS ID)? (',' ID (AS ID)?)*']')?``

A pure constraint pattern is a pattern that does not create any bindings
in the current scope.  Any pattern can be turned into a pure constraint pattern
by placing it between the ``%[`` and ``]%`` operators.

Example,
::
      let pos_int = pattern %[(x:%integer) if x > 0]%
      let i:*pos_int = val.

The first line defines a pure constraint pattern for the positive integers.
Notice that the pattern internally uses the variable ``x`` in order to evaluate
the conditional pattern but because it has been declared as a pure constraint
pattern this value binding is not exported to the current scope during pattern matching.
On the second line we constrain the pattern ``i`` to only the positive integer values using
the pure constraint pattern stored in ``p``.  This pattern match will only succeed if ``val``
evaluates to a postive integer.

Asteroid Grammar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is the complete grammar for the Asteroid language. Capitalized
words are either keywords such as ``FOR`` and ``END`` or tokens such as ``STRING`` and ``ID``.  Non-terminals
are written in all lowercase letters.  The grammar utilizes an extended BNF notation
where ``<syntactic unit>*`` means zero or more occurrences of the syntactic unit and
``<syntactic unit>+`` means one or more occurrences of the syntactic unit. Furthermore,
``<syntactic unit>?`` means that the syntactic unit is optional.  Simple terminals
are written in quotes.
::
#include "/tmp/grammar.tmp"


Builtin Functions
-----------------

**getid** x
      Returns a unique id of any Asteroid object as an integer.

**hd** x:%list
      Returns the first element of a list. It is an error to apply this 
      function to an empty list.

**isdefined** x:%string
      Returns true if a variable or type name is defined in the
      current environment otherwise it returns false. The variable or type name must be given as a string.
**len** x
      Returns the length of x. The
      function can only be applied to lists, strings, tuples, or structures.

**range**  stop:%integer | (start:%integer, stop:%integer) | (start:%integer, stop:%integer, inc:%integer)
      Compute a list of values depending on the input values:

      1. If only the stop value is given then the list [0 to stop-1] is returned.
      2. If the start and stop values are given then the list [start to stop-1] is returned.
      3. If in addition to the start and stop values the inc values is given then the list [start to stop-1 step inc] is returned.

**tl** x:%list
      Returns the rest of the list without the first element.  It is an 
      error to apply this function to an empty list.



List and String Objects
-----------------------

In Asteroid, both ``lists`` and ``strings,`` are treated like objects in the OO sense. Due to this, they have member functions that can manipulate the contents of those objects.

Lists
^^^^^

A **list** is a structured data type that consists of square brackets enclosing
comma-separated values.
Member functions on lists can be called on the data structure directly, e.g.::

   [1,2,3] @length ()

Member Functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

list **@append** item
      Adds the item to the end of the list.

list **@clear** ()
      Removes all items from the list.

list **@copy** ()
      Returns a shallow copy of the list.

list **@count** item
      Returns the number of times item appears in the list.

list **@extend** item
      Extend the list by adding all the elements from the item to the list where the item is either a list or a tuple.

list **@filter** f:%function
      Returns a list constructed from those elements for which function f returns true. 

list **@index** item | (item, loc(startix:%integer) | (item, loc(startix:%integer, endix:%integer))
      Returns a zero-based index of the first element whose value is equal to item. 
      It throws an exception if there is no such item. The argument loc allows you to specify 
      startix and endix and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of the list. 
      The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the list rather than the startix argument.   

list **@insert** (ix:%integer, item)
      Insert the item into the list at the position i.
      This means that ``a@insert(0, x)`` inserts x at the front of the list, and ``a@insert(a@length(), x)`` is equivalent to ``a@append(x)``.

list **@join** join_str:%string
      Turns the list into a string using join_str between the elements.  The string is returned
      as the return value from this function.

list **@length** ()
      Returns the number of elements within the list.

list **@map** f:%function
      Applies the function f to each element of the list in place. The modified list is returned.

list **@member** item
      Returns true only if item exists on the list.

list **@pop** () | ix:%integer
      Removes the item at the given position in the list and returns it. If no index is specified
      removes and returns the last item in the list.

list **@reduce** f:%function | (f:%function, init)
      Reduce the list to a value by applying the function f to all the members of the list. The function f has to be
      a function with two arguments where the first argument is the accumulator.  If no initial
      value is given then the first element of the list is assumed to be the first accumulator value.
      In order to illustrate, we have::

            let value = [1,2] @reduce (lambda with (x,y) do x+y, 0).
            assert(value == 3).

      is equivalent to ::

            let l = [1,2].
            let value = 0.
            for i in range(l@length()) do
                  let value = (lambda with (x,y) do x+y) (value,l@i).
            end
            assert(value == 3).

list **@remove** item
      Removes the first element from the list whose value is equal to item. 
      It throws an exception if there is no such item.

list **@reverse** ()
      Reverses the elements of the list in place and returns the reversed list.

list **@shuffle** ()
      Creates a random permutation of the list in place and returns the randomized list.

list **@sort** () | reverse:%boolean
      Sorts the items of the list in place and returns the sorted list. 
      If the boolean reverse is set to true then the sorted list is reversed.


Strings
^^^^^^^

A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes.
In Asteroid, single characters are represented as single character strings.
Similar to lists the member functions of strings can be called directly on the
data structure itself, e.g.::

   "Hello there" @length ()

Member Functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

string **@explode** ()
      Returns the string as a list of characters.

string **@flip** ()
      Returns a copy of the string with its characters in the reverse order.

string **@index** item:%string | (item:%string, loc(startix:%integer)) | (item:%string, loc(startix:%integer, endix:%integer))
      Returns an integer index of the item in the string or none if item was not found.  
      The  argument loc allows you to specify startix and endix and are used to limit the search 
      to a particular substring of the string. The returned index is computed relative to the beginning 
      of the full string rather than the startix.  

string **@length** ()
      Returns the number of characters within the string.

string **@replace** (old:%string, new:%string) | (old:%string, new:%string, count:%integer)
      Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of regular expression old replaced by the 
      string new. If the argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. 

string **@split** () | sep:%string | (sep:%string, count:%integer)
      Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter. If count is given then
      at most count splits are done (thus, the list will have at most count+1 elements). If count is 
      not specified or -1, then there is no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).
      Consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings. 
      For example,::
      
            let s = "1,,2" @split ",".
            assert (s == ["1", "", "2"]). 
            
      The sep argument may consist of multiple characters. 
      For example,:: 
      
            let s = "1<>2<>3" @split "<>". 
            assert (s == ["1", "2", "3"]).
            
      Splitting an empty string with a specified separator returns ``[""]``.
      If sep is not specified or is None, a different splitting algorithm is applied: 
      consecutive whitespace is regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at 
      the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string 
      or a string consisting of just whitespace with a none separator returns ``[]``.
 
string **@tolower** ()
      Returns a copy of the string in all lower case letters.

string **@toupper** ()
      Returns a copy of the string in all upper case letters.

string **@trim** () | what:%string
      Returns a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. 
      The what argument specifies the set of characters to be removed. 
      If omitted trim defaults to removing whitespace. 
      The what argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its characters are stripped.



Asteroid Modules
----------------

There are a number of system modules that can be loaded into an Asteroid program using ``load system <module name>``.
The modules are implemented as objects where all the functions of that module are
member functions of that module object. For example, in the case of the ``io`` module
we have ``println`` as one of the member functions.  To call that function::

   load system io.
   io @println "Hello there!".  -- println is a member function of the io module

bitwise
^^^^^^^

This module defines bitwise operations on integers. It supports the following functions,

bitwise **@band** (x:%integer, y:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise AND operation and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@bclearbit** (x:%integer, i:%integer)
      Clear the ith bit in x and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@blrotate** (x:%integer, i:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise left rotate operation by i bits and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@blshift** (x:%integer, y:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise left shift operation where x is shifted by y bits and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@bnot** x:%integer
      Performs the bitwise NOT operation and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@bor** (x:%integer, y:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise OR operation and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@brrotate** (x:%integer, i:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise right rotate operation by i bits and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@brshift** (x:%integer, y:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise right shift operation where x is shifted by y bits and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@bsetbit** (x:%integer, i:%integer)
      Sets the ith bit in x and returns the result as an integer.

bitwise **@bsize** x:%integer
      Returns the bit size of x.

bitwise **@bxor** (x:%integer, y:%integer)
      Performs the bitwise XOR operation and returns the result as an integer.


hash
^^^^

The `hash <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/hash.ast>`_ module implements a hash for name-values pairs. It supports the following functions,

* Function ``insert``, given the input ``(name,value)``, will insert a given name-value pair into the table.
* Function ``get``, given ``name``, will return the ``value`` associated with the given ``name`` as long as it can be found otherwise an exception will be thrown.
* Function ``aslist`` returns the hash as a list of name-value pairs.

io
^^

The `io <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/io.ast>`_ module implements Asteroid's I/O system. The module defines three default streams,

1. ``__STDIN__`` - the standard input stream.
2. ``__STDOUT__`` - the standard output stream.
3. ``__STDERR__`` - the standard error stream.

Furthermore, the module supports the following functions,

* Function ``println`` can be called with ``item``, and prints a given argument to the terminal (``__STDOUT__``) with an implicit newline character.
* Function ``print`` can be called with ``item``, and prints a given argument. No implicit newline is appended to the output.
* Function ``input`` can be called with a string ``prompt``.  If ``prompt`` is given it is printed and then input is read from the terminal (``__STDIN__``) and returned as a string.
* Function ``open`` opens a file. Given ``(name:%string, mode:%string)``, it returns a file descriptor of type ``FILE``. The ``mode`` string can be ``"r"`` when the file will only be read, ``"w"`` for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased), and ``"a"`` opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. The ``"r+"`` opens the file for both reading and writing.
* Function ``close``, given ``file:%FILE``, closes that file.
* Function ``read``, given ``file:%FILE``, reads a file. If no file is given the ``__STDIN__`` stream is read.
* Function ``readln``, given ``file:%FILE``, reads a given line of input from the file. If no file is given the ``__STDIN__`` stream is read.
* Function ``write``, given ``(file:%FILE, what:%string)``, will write ``what`` to the given ``file``.  If ``file`` is not given then it writes to the ``__STDOUT__`` stream.
* Function ``writeln``, works the same way as ``write`` except that it appends a newline character to the output.

math
^^^^

The `math <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/math.ast>`_ module implements mathematical constants and functions. It supports the following functions,

Power and logarithmic functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Function ``exp``, given ``x:%integer``, returns e raised to the power ``x``, where e = 2.718281… is the base of natural logarithms.
* Function ``log`` can be called with two different argument setups,

  1. If only one argument, ``(x)``, is input, this returns the natural logarithm of x (to base e).
  2. If two arguments, ``(x,base)``, are input, this returns the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as log(x)/log(base).

* Function ``pow``, given ``(b,p:%integer)``, returns "b <sup>p</sup>" as long as b is either ``real`` or ``integer``.
* Function ``sqrt``, given ``a``, returns its square root as long as ``a`` is either ``real`` or ``integer``.

Number-theoretic and representation functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Function ``abs``, given ``x``, returns its absolute value.

* Function ``floor``, given ``x:%real``, returns the floor of x: the largest integer less than or equal to x.
* Function ``gcd``, given ``(a:%integer,b:%integer)``, returns the greatest common denominator that both integers share.
* Function ``isclose`` can be called with two different argument setups,

  1. With input values ``(a,b)``, it returns returns ``true`` if the two values are close to each other and ``False`` otherwise. Default tolerance 1e-09.
  2. With input values ``(a,b,t)``, it compares ``a`` and ``b`` with tolerance ``t``.

* Function ``mod``, given ``(v,d)``, will return the remainder of the operation ``v/d``, as long as ``v`` and ``d`` are either ``real`` or ``integer`` values.

Trigonometric functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Function ``acos``, given ``x``, returns the arc cosine of x in radians. The result is between 0 and pi.
* Function ``asin``, given ``x``, returns the arc sine of x in radians. The result is between -pi/2 and pi/2.
* Function ``atan``, ,given ``x``, returns the arc tangent of x in radians. The result is between -pi/2 and pi/2.
* Function ``cos``, given ``x``, returns the cosine of x radians.
* Function ``sin``, given ``x``, returns the sine of x radians.
* Function ``tan``, given ``x``, returns the tangent of x radians.
* Function ``acosh``, given ``x``, returns the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x.
* Function ``asinh``, given ``x``, returns the inverse hyperbolic sine of x.
* Function ``atanh``, given ``x``, returns the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x.

pick
^^^^

The `pick <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/pick.ast>`_ module implements
pick objects that allow a user to randomly pick items from a list using the ``pick`` function.
The ``pick`` function can be called with ``n:%integer`` and returns a list of ``n`` randomly picked objects from the object list.
Here is a simple use case
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ref-programs/pick.ast"


random
^^^^^^

The `random <https://github.com/lutzhamel/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/random.ast>`_ module implements the ``random`` numbers. Using the functions included in this module will return a random value within a given range or interval. It supports the following functions,

* Function ``random``, given the input ``none``, returns a random floating point number in the range ``[0.0, 1.0)``.
* Function ``randint`` returns a random value N in the interval lo <= N <= hi. The exact random value output depends on the types of the values specifying the interval. It can be called with two different number interval inputs:

  1. ``(lo:%integer,hi:%integer)``
  2. ``(lo:%real,hi:%real)``
  3. Note: any other interval specification will instead output an error message for "unsupported interval specification in randint."

* Function ``seed``, given ``(sd:%integer)``, provides a seed value for the random number generator.

set
^^^

The `set <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/set.ast>`_ module implements Asteroid sets as lists. Unlike lists, sets do not have repeated members. It supports the following functions,

* Function ``toset``, given ``(lst:%list)``, converts the input list into a set.
* Function ``diff``, given ``(a:%list,b:%list)``, computes the difference set between the two set ``a`` and ``b``.
* Function ``intersection``, given ``(a:%list,b:%list)``, finds the intersection between  sets ``a`` and ``b``.
* Function ``union``, given ``(a:%list,b:%list)``, computes the union of sets ``a`` and ``b``.
* Function ``xunion``, given ``(a:%list,b:%list)``, returns all elements in ``a`` or ``b``, but not in both.

sort
^^^^

The `sort <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/sort.ast>`_ module
defines a parameterized ``sort`` function over a list.
The ``sort`` function makes use of a user-defined order predicate on the list's elements to
perform the sort. The ``Quicksort`` is the underlying sort algorithm.
The following is a simple example,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ref-programs/sort.ast"

prints the sorted list::

  [5,10,50,110]

stream
^^^^^^

The `stream <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/stream.ast>`_ module implements streams that allow
the developer to turn any list into a stream supporting interface functions like ``peeking`` ahead or ``rewinding`` the stream.
The following stream interface functions are available,

* Function ``eof`` returns ``true`` if the stream does not contain any further elements for processing. Otherwise it returns ``false``.
* Function ``peek`` returns the current element available on the stream otherwise it returns ``none``.
* Function ``get`` returns the current element and moves the stream pointer one ahead.
* Function ``rewind`` resets the stream pointer to the first element of the stream.
* Function ``map`` applies a given function to each element in the stream.
* Function ``append``, given ``item``, adds item to the end of the stream.
* Function ``__string__`` maps a the stream to a string representation.

A simple use case.
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ref-programs/stream.ast"

which outputs::

   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10


type
^^^^

The `type <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/type.ast>`_ module defines type related functions and structures.

Type Conversion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Function ``tointeger`` converts a given input to an integer. It can be called with two different arguments,

  1. ``(item:%string,base:%integer)`` where ``base`` is a valid base for integer conversion
  2. ``item`` where ``item`` is converted to a base 10 integer.


* Function ``toreal``, given ``item``, returns the input as a real number data type.
* Function ``toboolean``, given ``item``, returns the input as a Boolean value of either true or false.
* Function ``tostring`` converts an Asteroid object to a string. If format values are given, it applies the formatting to the object. It can be called with several different inputs where ``*TP`` indicates a``boolean``, ``integer``, or ``string`` type and ``w`` is the width specification, ``p`` is the precision specification and ``s`` is the scientific notation flag.  When no formatting information is provided a default string conversion occurs,

  1. ``(v:*TP,type @stringformat(w:%integer))``
  2. ``(v:%real,type @stringformat(w:%integer))``
  3. ``(v:%real,type @stringformat(w:%integer,p:%integer))``
  4. ``(v:%real,type @stringformat(w:%integer,p:%integer,s:%boolean))``
  5. ``item`` - default conversion

* Function ``tobase`` represents the given integer ``x`` (*specifically* within the given input ``(x:%integer,base:%integer)``) as a string in the given base.

Here is a program that exercises some of the string formatting options,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ref-programs/format.ast"

The output of the program is,
::

          true
        5
                      hello there!
     3.142

Notice the right justification of the various values within the given string length.


Type Query Functions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Function ``islist`` returns ``true`` if given ``item`` is a list otherwise it will return ``false``.
* Function ``isscalar`` returns ``true`` if given ``item`` is either an integer or a real value.
* Function ``isnone`` returns ``true`` if given ``item`` is equal to the value ``none``.
* Function ``gettype`` returns the type of a given ``item`` as an Asteroid string.

A simple example program using the ``gettype`` function,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ref-programs/type.ast"

util
^^^^

The `util <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/util.ast>`_ module defines utility functions and structures that don't really fit into any omodules. It supports the following functions,

* Function ``copy``, given Asteroid object ``obj``, makes a deep copy of it.
* Function ``cls`` clears the terminal screen.
* Function ``sleep``,  programs sleep for ``secs`` seconds where the argument ``secs`` is either an integer or real value.
* Function ``zip``, given ``(list1:%list,list2:%list)``, will return a list where element ``i`` of the list is the tuple ``(list1@i,list2@i)``.
* Function ``unzip``, given a list of pairs will return a pair of lists where the first component of the pair is the list of all the first components of the pairs of the input list and the second component of the return list is a list of all the second components of the input list.
* Function ``ascii``, given a character ``item:%string``, returns the corresponding ASCII code of the first character of the input string.
* Function ``achar``, given a decimal ASCII code ``item:%integer``, returns the corresponding character symbol.
* Function ``time``, returns the local time as a real value in secs since 1/1/1970.
* Function ``ctime``, given a real value representing seconds since 1/1/1970 this function converts it to a suitable string representation of the date.

vector
^^^^^^

The `vector <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/vector.ast>`_ defines functions useful for vector arithmetic. It supports the following functions.  Here ``a`` and ``b`` are vectors implemented as lists,

* Function ``add``, given the input ``(a,b)``, returns a vector that contains the element by element sum of the input vectors.
* Function ``sub``, given the input ``(a,b)``, returns the element by element difference vector.
* Function ``mult``, given the input ``(a,b)``, returns the element by element vector multiplication.
* Function ``dot``, given ``(a,b)``, computes the dot product of the two vectors.
* Function ``op``  allows the developer to vectorize any function. It can be called with three different inputs:

  1. ``(f:%function,a:%list,b:%list)``
  2. ``(f:%function,a:%list,b if type @isscalar(b))``
  3. ``(f:%function,a if type @isscalar(a),b:%list)``

Here is a simple example program for the ``vector`` module,
::
#include "../asteroid/test-suites/ref-programs/vector.ast"

which prints the value ``0``.

Interfacing Asteroid with Python
--------------------------------

Asteroid allows integration with Python in one of two ways.  First, we can call the
Asteroid interpreter from within a Python program and second, we can embed
Python code directly within an Asteroid program. We start with looking at
calling the Asteroid interpreter from Python.

Calling Asteroid from Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Calling Asteroid from within a Python program is nothing more than calling Asteroid's ``interp``
function with a string representing an Asteroid program as its argument.  In order to make this work you
will have to make sure that the Python interpreter can find the Asteroid modules.
Here we assume that you have installed Asteroid with the ``pip`` installer.
Once you have installed Asteroid you will have to point the ``PYTHONPATH``
environment variable to the directory where ``pip`` installed the Asteroid modules.
You can easily find out where the modules are installed by issuing the ``show`` command,
::
    ubuntu$ pip3 show asteroid-lang
    Name: asteroid-lang
    Version: 1.1.3
    Summary: A pattern-matching oriented programming language.
    Home-page: https://asteroid-lang.org
    Author: University of Rhode Island
    Author-email: lutzhamel@uri.edu
    License: None
    Location: /home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
    Requires: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
    Required-by:
    ubuntu$

The ``Location`` field tells us where the Asteroid modules have been installed.
Under Ubuntu we can now create an environment variable that points to that directory as follows,
::
    ubuntu$ export PYTHONPATH=/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages
    ubuntu$

Now that Python knows how to find the Asteroid modules we can import the
Asteroid interpreter into any Python program using,
::
   from asteroid.interp import interp

where the ``interp`` function takes a string representing of an Asteroid program
as an argument.  Let's test drive this in the Python interactive shell,
::
    ubuntu$ python3
    Python 3.8.10 (default, Nov 26 2021, 20:14:08)
    [GCC 9.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from asteroid.interp import interp
    >>> interp('load system io. io @println "Hello, World!".')
    Hello, World!
    >>>

For more detailed information on the ``interp`` function do a ``help(interp)``
at the interactive Python prompt.
Even though we have shown this example under Linux, analogous approaches
should work on both Windows and macOS.

Not only can we execute the Asteroid interpreter
from Python but we can also access its state to look up the results of a
computation for example.  Here is a slight variation of the program above
where the Asteroid program computes the string value containing the greeting but
we are actually printing the value from Python,
::
      hash_comment import Asteroid modules
      from asteroid.interp import interp
      from asteroid.state import state

      hash_comment run the interpreter to compute the greeting string
      interp('let s = "Hello World!".')

      hash_comment retrieve the greeting string from the interpreter state
      hash_comment notice the pair of values a symbol table lookup produces:
      hash_comment one for the type of the value and one for the actual value
      (type,val) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('s')
      print(type)
      print(val)

The program prints out,
::
      string
      Hello World!



Embedding Python into an Asteroid Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using Asteroid's ``escape`` expression allows us to embed arbitray Python
code into an Asteroid program,
::
      -- Printing hello once from each environment

      -- print hello from Asteroid
      load system io.
      io @println "Hello World from Asteroid!".

      -- print hello from Python
      escape
      "
      print('Hello World from Python!')
      ".

Please note that the format of the Python code in the escaped string should follow the
same guidelines as the Python code embedded in strings handed to the Python `exec
function <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec>`_.

Not only does the ``escape`` expression give you access to the Python environment but
it also gives you access to the current Asteroid interpreter state including its
symbol table.  That means we can access any variable defined in the Asteroid
environment from Python,
::
      let s = "Hello World!".

      escape
      "
      (type, val) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('s')
      print(type)
      print(val)
      ".

Notice that a symbol table lookup produces a pair of values where the first value
represents the type of the value stored in the symbol table and the second value
is the actual value stored.  In this case our program prints out,
::
      string
      Hello World!

That is the type of the value is a string and the value is the actual string ``Hello World!``.

Since ``escape`` represents an expression we can also return values from the
Python code using a special ``__retval__`` variable.  The only trick is that
we have to remember that values in Asteroid are pairs consisting of type information
and values.  Here is a very simple program that exercises that part of the Python API,
::
      load system io.

      let i = escape
      "
      global __retval__  # access the return value register

      __retval__ = ('integer', 101)
      ".

      io @println i.

This program will print out the value ``101`` from Asteroid even though that value
was created within the Python environment.  Notice that we have to access the
return value register ``__retval__`` with the ``global`` statement in the Python code.

We can pull all of this together and write an Asteroid function that performs its
computations in Python,
::
      function inc with i do return escape
      "
      hash_comment access return value register
      global __retval__
      hash_comment lookup the value of the formal argument
      (type, val) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('i')

      hash_comment only perform the increment if the value is an integer
      if type != 'integer':
         raise ValueError('not an integer')
      else:
         __retval__ = (type, val+1)
      ".
      end

      -- call inc and make sure the result is correct
      let k = inc(1)
      assert(k == 2).

Of course the function is just an illustration of how to use the Python API.  This
type of computation is much easier to express in Asteroid directly,
::
      function inc
         with i:%integer do
            i+1
         end

      let k = inc(1)
      assert(k == 2).

The Foreign Type Tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When working in the hybrid Asteroid-Python environment it is sometimes useful to be able to embed values
in an Asteroid program that have no direct representation in Asteroid.  This is where the ``foreign``
type tage comes into play.  Consider the following program that uses Pandas dataframes within an
Asteroid program,
::

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      function pack
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      -- this function packs four real values into a Pandas dataframe
      with (a:%real,b:%real,c:%real,d:%real) do return escape
      "
      global __retval__
      hash_comment we can ignore type info here because we checked it above
      (_, aval) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('a')
      (_, bval) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('b')
      (_, cval) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('c')
      (_, dval) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('d')

      import pandas as pd
      df = pd.DataFrame({'x':[aval,bval], 'y':[cval,dval]})
      __retval__ = ('foreign', df)
      "
      end

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      function dump
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      -- dump the Pandas dataframe to stdout
      with df do escape
      "
      (dftype, dfval) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('df')
      if dftype != 'foreign':
         raise ValueError('expected data frame')
      print(dfval)
      "
      end

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      function access
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
      -- access an element of the Pandas dataframe at row r and column c
      with (df,r:%integer,c:%integer) do return escape
      "
      global __retval__
      (dftype, dfval) = state.symbol_table.lookup_sym('df')

      -- exercise our machinery
      let df = pack(1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0).
      dump(df).
      assert(access(df,1,1) == 4).
      assert(sum(df) == (3.0,7.0)).

The ``dump`` function generates the following output,
::
           x    y
      0  1.0  3.0
      1  2.0  4.0

Pandas dataframes are not directly usable in Asteroid but by writing thin Python
wrappers and taking advantage of the ``escape`` expression the ``foreign`` type
tag we can embed Pandas functionality into Asteroid.  As an additional step we could
wrap these individual functions into a ``structure`` with the dataframe as
a data member and the functions as member functions of that structure.  As an
example of this approach see the `dataframe.ast <https://github.com/asteroid-lang/asteroid/blob/master/asteroid/modules/dataframe.ast>`_ system module.
